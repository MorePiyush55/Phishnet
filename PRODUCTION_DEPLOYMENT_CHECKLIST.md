VITE_ENVIRONMENT=production
VITE_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI=https://your-frontend.vercel.app/auth/callback
VITE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id

# Build Command:
npm run build

# Output Directory:
dist
```

### 3. Google OAuth Configuration
```
Authorized JavaScript Origins:
- https://your-frontend.vercel.app
- https://your-render-app.onrender.com

Authorized Redirect URIs:
- https://your-render-app.onrender.com/auth/callback
- https://your-frontend.vercel.app/auth/callback
```
