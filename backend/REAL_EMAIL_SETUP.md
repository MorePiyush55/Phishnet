# üî¥ REAL EMAIL CONFIGURATION GUIDE
# For PhishNet IMAP Integration with propam5553@gmail.com

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Using REAL Emails, Not Test Data

This project uses **propam5553@gmail.com** as the actual test email account. This means:

‚úÖ **DO:** Use REAL phishing/suspicious emails  
‚ùå **DON'T:** Use fake/test emails or mock data

---

## üìß Email Account Setup

### Account: propam5553@gmail.com

This account should be used to:
1. **Receive forwarded suspicious emails** from users
2. **Store real phishing attempts** for analysis
3. **Test the Enhanced Phishing Analyzer** with actual threats

## üîÑ Testing Workflow with Real Emails

### For Developers/Testers:

1. **Find a Real Phishing Email**
   - Check spam folder in propam5553@gmail.com
   - Or forward from your own spam folder

2. **Forward as Attachment**
   ```
   1. Open the suspicious email
   2. Click More (‚ãÆ) ‚Üí Forward as attachment
   3. To: propam5553@gmail.com
   4. Subject: [Optional] Add note about this email
   5. Send
   ```

3. **Run Test Script**
   ```powershell
   cd backend
   python test_imap_integration.py
   ```

4. **Review Results**
   - Check phishing score (0-100%)
   - Review risk factors
   - Validate detection accuracy

---

## üìä Expected Test Results

### Real Phishing Email Example:
```
Subject: "Your account will be suspended"

## üß™ Testing Checklist

Before running tests, ensure you have:

- [ ] Gmail App Password for propam5553@gmail.com
- [ ] IMAP enabled in Gmail settings
- [ ] `.env` file created with correct credentials
- [ ] At least 2-3 REAL phishing emails forwarded
- [ ] At least 1-2 REAL legitimate emails forwarded
- [ ] MongoDB running (for storing results)
- [ ] Redis running (optional, for caching)

---

## üîí Security Best Practices

### 1. App Password Security
- ‚úÖ Never commit `.env` to git
- ‚úÖ Use App Password, not regular password
- ‚úÖ Regenerate if compromised
- ‚úÖ Store securely (password manager)

### 2. Email Account Security
- ‚úÖ Enable 2-Factor Authentication
- ‚úÖ Monitor for unauthorized access
- ‚úÖ Use dedicated account (not personal)
- ‚úÖ Regularly review connected apps

### 3. Phishing Email Handling
- ‚úÖ Don't click links in phishing emails
- ‚úÖ Don't download attachments from suspicious emails
- ‚úÖ Use sandboxed environment for testing
- ‚úÖ Archive analyzed emails

---

## üìà Continuous Testing Strategy

### Daily Testing:
1. Check propam5553@gmail.com for new spam
2. Forward 2-3 suspicious emails
3. Run analysis
4. Review detection accuracy

### Weekly Testing:
1. Collect 10+ real phishing emails
2. Batch analyze using API
3. Calculate detection rate
4. Review false positives/negatives

### Monthly Testing:
1. Update phishing keyword database
2. Test with latest phishing campaigns
3. Tune analyzer weights if needed
4. Document improvements

## üêõ Troubleshooting with Real Emails

### Issue: "No emails found"
**Check:**
- Are emails in INBOX folder? (not Spam)
- Were emails forwarded "as attachment"?
- Is IMAP_FOLDER set correctly in .env?

### Issue: "Analysis shows 100% for phishing email"
**This is EXPECTED if:**
- Email is from a legitimate company's official domain
- SPF/DKIM/DMARC all pass
- No suspicious keywords found
- All links are HTTPS to legitimate domains

**The analyzer is working correctly!** Not all spam is phishing.

### Issue: "Analysis shows 0% for legitimate email"
**Check if email has:**
- Suspicious sender domain
- Urgency keywords (ACT NOW, VERIFY, SUSPENDED)
- Failed SPF/DKIM checks
- Suspicious links or redirects

**This might be a false positive - review and tune if needed.**
