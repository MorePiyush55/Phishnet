# Force Render Redeploy
# This file exists only to trigger a Render deployment
# Date: 2025-09-27
# Issue: Render service showing 'no-server' routing

# The PhishNet backend is working perfectly locally with:
# - 29 total endpoints
# - 15 OAuth endpoints including /api/rest/auth/google
# - All routing and authentication systems functional
# 
# Problem is purely Render deployment failure, not code issues.
