# IMAP Email Integration - Quick Start Guide

## üöÄ What's New

PhishNet now supports **ThePhish-style email forwarding** - a simple way for users to report suspicious emails without complex OAuth setup!

### How It Works
1. User receives suspicious email
2. User forwards it **as attachment** to phishnet@yourcompany.com
3. Analyst selects email from pending list
4. System analyzes with 5-module Enhanced Analyzer
5. Results stored in MongoDB, analyst receives report

## ‚ö° 15-Minute Setup

### Step 1: Get Gmail App Password (5 minutes)

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Using REAL email account propam5553@gmail.com**

1. Log in to **propam5553@gmail.com**
2. Go to https://myaccount.google.com/security
3. Enable 2-Factor Authentication if not already enabled
4. Go to https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
5. Select app: "Mail", device: "Other (PhishNet)"
6. Click "Generate"
7. **Copy the 16-character password** (example: `abcd efgh ijkl mnop`)

### Step 2: Configure IMAP (2 minutes)

Add to your `.env` file:

```bash
# IMAP Email Forwarding (ThePhish-style)
# ‚ö†Ô∏è Using REAL email account for testing
IMAP_ENABLED=true
IMAP_HOST=imap.gmail.com
IMAP_PORT=993
IMAP_USER=propam5553@gmail.com
IMAP_PASSWORD=your_16_char_app_password
IMAP_FOLDER=INBOX
IMAP_POLL_INTERVAL=60
```

**Replace:**
- `your_16_char_app_password` ‚Üí App password from Step 1

**‚ö†Ô∏è NOTE:** This is your actual test email account. Use REAL phishing emails, not fake/test data!

### Step 3: Test Connection (3 minutes)

```powershell
# Navigate to backend
cd backend

# Run test script
python test_imap_integration.py
```

Expected output:
```
‚úÖ IMAP connection successful!
```

If connection fails:
- ‚ùå Check App Password (remove spaces)
- ‚ùå Enable IMAP in Gmail: Settings ‚Üí Forwarding and POP/IMAP ‚Üí Enable IMAP
- ‚ùå Check firewall allows port 993

### Step 4: Test Forwarding (5 minutes)

**‚ö†Ô∏è Use REAL phishing emails, not test/fake emails!**

1. Find a **REAL phishing email** (check spam folder in propam5553@gmail.com)
2. Open the suspicious email
3. Click **More (‚ãÆ)** ‚Üí **Forward as attachment**
4. Send to: `propam5553@gmail.com`
5. Run test script again:
   ```powershell
   python test_imap_integration.py
   ```

**üí° Where to find real phishing emails:**
- Gmail spam folder
- Security alerts
- Phishing simulation campaigns
- User-reported suspicious emails

Expected output:
```
‚úÖ Found 1 pending email(s):
1. UID: 12345
   From: sender@example.com
   Subject: Test Email
   Date: 2024-01-15 10:30:00
```

## üÜö IMAP vs OAuth Comparison

| Feature | IMAP (New) | OAuth (Existing) |
|---------|-----------|------------------|
| **Setup Time** | 15 minutes | 2-3 hours |
| **Configuration** | App Password | Google Cloud Console |
| **User Action** | Forward as attachment | Auto-scan inbox |
| **Analyst Control** | Manual selection | Automated |
| **Gmail Quotas** | No API quotas | API rate limits |
| **Email Access** | Forwarded only | Full mailbox |
| **Best For** | User-reported phishing | Proactive scanning |

**Recommendation:** Use both!
- **IMAP** for user-reported suspicious emails (high priority)
- **OAuth** for automated scanning of all incoming emails

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Connection Fails

**Error:** "Authentication failed"
```
‚úì Check App Password (no spaces, 16 characters)
‚úì Regenerate App Password if needed
‚úì Ensure 2FA is enabled on Gmail account
```

**Error:** "Connection timeout"
```
‚úì Check internet connection
‚úì Verify port 993 is open (firewall/antivirus)
‚úì Try IMAP_HOST=imap.gmail.com vs IP address
```

### No Emails Found

**"No pending emails found"**
```
‚úì Ensure email was forwarded **as attachment**
‚úì Check IMAP_FOLDER setting (default: INBOX)
‚úì Verify email arrived at IMAP_USER address
‚úì Check if email is marked as read
```

### Analysis Fails

**"Failed to extract EML attachment"**
```
‚úì Ensure forwarded **as attachment**, not regular forward
‚úì Check email format (.eml or .msg)
‚úì Try with different email client
```

### Performance Issues

**"Analysis too slow"**
```
‚úì Check Redis connection (caching)
‚úì Check MongoDB connection
‚úì Verify network latency to external APIs
‚úì Consider increasing server resources
```

## üìä Monitoring

### Health Check
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/imap-emails/test-connection
```

### Logs
```bash
# Check IMAP service logs
tail -f logs/phishnet.log | grep "IMAP"

# Check analysis logs
tail -f logs/phishnet.log | grep "EnhancedPhishingAnalyzer"
```

### Metrics
```bash
# Pending emails count
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/imap-emails/pending | jq '.total'

# Analysis statistics
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/imap-emails/stats
```

---

## üöÄ Production Deployment

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Required
IMAP_ENABLED=true
IMAP_USER=phishnet@company.com
IMAP_PASSWORD=your_app_password

# Optional (defaults shown)
IMAP_HOST=imap.gmail.com
IMAP_PORT=993
IMAP_FOLDER=INBOX
IMAP_POLL_INTERVAL=60
```

### System Requirements
- Python 3.11+
- 2GB RAM minimum
- MongoDB running
- Redis running (optional, improves performance)

### Security Considerations
1. **App Password:** Treat like regular password, never commit to git
2. **IMAP Folder:** Create dedicated folder (e.g., "PhishNet Reports")
3. **Email Retention:** Set up auto-archive after analysis
4. **Rate Limiting:** Consider API rate limits for /analyze endpoint
5. **Email Notifications:** Configure SMTP for analyst notifications

### Scaling
- **Low Volume (<100 emails/day):** Single server, IMAP_POLL_INTERVAL=60
- **Medium Volume (<1000 emails/day):** Multiple workers, IMAP_POLL_INTERVAL=30
- **High Volume (>1000 emails/day):** Distributed workers, dedicated IMAP service
