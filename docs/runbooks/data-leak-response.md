# Data Leak Incident Response

## Overview
This runbook provides procedures for handling suspected or confirmed data leaks in the PhishNet system, including customer data, analysis results, or system credentials.

## Incident Classification
- **Severity**: Critical (Data security incident)
- **Impact**: Potential data exposure, compliance violations
- **Type**: Data breach / information disclosure

## Detection and Alerting

### Symptoms
- Unauthorized access to sensitive data repositories
- Unusual data transfer patterns or volumes
- Database queries accessing large amounts of sensitive data
- Exposed API endpoints returning sensitive information
- External reports of PhishNet data exposure
- Security scanning alerts on data exposure

### Monitoring Alerts
```yaml
# Prometheus Alerts

## Immediate Response (0-10 minutes)

### 1. EMERGENCY: Assess and Contain
```bash
# Immediately check scope of potential leak
echo "=== EMERGENCY DATA LEAK RESPONSE ==="
echo "Timestamp: $(date -u)"
echo "Incident ID: PHISHNET-DL-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)"

# Check active database connections
kubectl exec -n phishnet statefulset/postgres -- psql -U phishnet_user -d phishnet -c "
  SELECT pid, usename, application_name, client_addr, state, query_start, query 
  FROM pg_stat_activity 
  WHERE state = 'active' AND usename != 'postgres' 
  ORDER BY query_start DESC;
"

# Check recent API access logs
kubectl logs -n phishnet deployment/phishnet-api --since=10m | grep -E "(GET|POST|PUT|DELETE)" | tail -20
```

### 2. Immediate Containment Actions
```bash
# Block suspicious IP addresses (if identified)
SUSPICIOUS_IPS="[IP addresses from investigation]"
for ip in $SUSPICIOUS_IPS; do
  kubectl exec -n phishnet deployment/nginx-ingress -- iptables -A INPUT -s $ip -j DROP
done

# Temporarily disable API endpoints with sensitive data
kubectl patch configmap phishnet-api-config -n phishnet -p '{"data":{"DISABLE_SENSITIVE_ENDPOINTS":"true"}}'

# Restart API to apply configuration
kubectl rollout restart deployment/phishnet-api -n phishnet

# Scale down workers to prevent further data processing
kubectl scale deployment phishnet-worker-email --replicas=0 -n phishnet
kubectl scale deployment phishnet-worker-analysis --replicas=0 -n phishnet
```

### 3. Evidence Preservation
```bash
# Capture current system state
INCIDENT_ID="PHISHNET-DL-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)"
mkdir -p /tmp/incident-evidence-$INCIDENT_ID

# Capture database logs
kubectl logs -n phishnet statefulset/postgres --since=1h > /tmp/incident-evidence-$INCIDENT_ID/postgres-logs.txt

# Capture API access logs
kubectl logs -n phishnet deployment/phishnet-api --since=1h > /tmp/incident-evidence-$INCIDENT_ID/api-logs.txt

# Capture ingress logs
kubectl logs -n phishnet deployment/nginx-ingress --since=1h > /tmp/incident-evidence-$INCIDENT_ID/ingress-logs.txt

# Capture current database state
kubectl exec -n phishnet statefulset/postgres -- pg_dumpall --roles-only > /tmp/incident-evidence-$INCIDENT_ID/database-roles.sql
```

### 4. Alert Stakeholders

      "severity": "critical",
      "source": "phishnet-monitoring"
    }
  }'
```

## Investigation (10-30 minutes)

### 1. Determine Scope of Exposure
```bash
# Analyze database access patterns
kubectl exec -n phishnet statefulset/postgres -- psql -U phishnet_user -d phishnet -c "
  SELECT 
    EXTRACT(hour FROM query_start) as hour,
    usename,
    client_addr,
    COUNT(*) as query_count,
    COUNT(DISTINCT query) as unique_queries
  FROM pg_stat_activity_history 
  WHERE query_start >= NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
    AND query ILIKE '%SELECT%'
  GROUP BY hour, usename, client_addr
  ORDER BY query_count DESC
  LIMIT 20;
"

# Check for bulk data extraction queries
kubectl exec -n phishnet statefulset/postgres -- psql -U phishnet_user -d phishnet -c "
  SELECT query_start, usename, client_addr, query
  FROM pg_stat_activity_history 
  WHERE query_start >= NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
    AND (
      query ILIKE '%LIMIT%' 
      OR query ILIKE '%COUNT%' 
      OR query ILIKE '%email_content%'
      OR query ILIKE '%analysis_result%'
    )
  ORDER BY query_start DESC
  LIMIT 50;
"
```

### 2. API Access Analysis
```bash
# Analyze API access patterns for bulk data requests
kubectl logs -n phishnet deployment/phishnet-api --since=24h | grep -E "GET.*/(emails|files|analysis)" | \
  awk '{print $1, $7}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -20

# Check for authenticated vs unauthenticated access
kubectl logs -n phishnet deployment/phishnet-api --since=24h | grep -E "(401|403|200)" | \
  awk '{print $9}' | sort | uniq -c

# Look for data export endpoints usage
kubectl logs -n phishnet deployment/phishnet-api --since=24h | grep -E "(export|download|bulk)" | head -50
```

### 3. Network Traffic Analysis
```bash
# Check outbound data transfers
kubectl exec -n phishnet deployment/network-monitor -- netstat -i | grep -E "RX|TX"

# Analyze DNS queries for potential data exfiltration
kubectl logs -n phishnet deployment/dns-monitor --since=1h | grep -v -E "(internal|cluster\.local)" | head -20

# Check for unusual connection patterns
kubectl exec -n phishnet deployment/phishnet-api -- ss -tuln | grep ESTABLISHED
```

### 4. File System Analysis
```bash
# Check for unauthorized file access
kubectl exec -n phishnet deployment/phishnet-api -- find /app/uploads -type f -newermt '1 hour ago' -exec ls -la {} \;

# Look for potential data staging areas
kubectl exec -n phishnet deployment/phishnet-api -- find /tmp -name "*.csv" -o -name "*.json" -o -name "*.sql" 2>/dev/null

# Check for compressed files that might contain extracted data
kubectl exec -n phishnet deployment/phishnet-api -- find /app -name "*.zip" -o -name "*.tar.gz" -newermt '24 hours ago' 2>/dev/null
```

## Data Classification and Impact Assessment (30-60 minutes)

### 1. Identify Compromised Data Types
```bash
# Query specific data types that may have been accessed
cat << 'EOF' > /tmp/data-assessment.sql
-- Check recently accessed email data
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as email_count,
  COUNT(DISTINCT sender_email) as unique_senders,
  MIN(received_date) as earliest_email,
  MAX(received_date) as latest_email
FROM emails 
WHERE last_accessed >= NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours';

-- Check recently accessed file analysis data
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as file_count,
  COUNT(DISTINCT file_hash) as unique_files,
  STRING_AGG(DISTINCT analysis_type, ', ') as analysis_types
FROM file_analysis 
WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours';

-- Check user data access
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as user_count,
  COUNT(DISTINCT email) as unique_users,
  STRING_AGG(DISTINCT role, ', ') as roles_accessed
FROM users 
WHERE last_login >= NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours';

-- Check sensitive configuration access
SELECT 
  key,
  last_accessed,
  accessed_by
FROM system_config 
WHERE last_accessed >= NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
  AND key LIKE '%secret%' OR key LIKE '%password%' OR key LIKE '%key%';
EOF

kubectl exec -n phishnet statefulset/postgres -- psql -U phishnet_user -d phishnet -f /tmp/data-assessment.sql
```

### 2. Calculate Business Impact
```bash
# Assess customer impact
cat << 'EOF' > /tmp/customer-impact.sql
SELECT 
  c.company_name,
  COUNT(DISTINCT e.id) as affected_emails,
  COUNT(DISTINCT f.id) as affected_files,
  c.subscription_tier,
  c.compliance_requirements
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN emails e ON c.id = e.customer_id AND e.last_accessed >= NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
LEFT JOIN file_analysis f ON c.id = f.customer_id AND f.created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
WHERE (e.id IS NOT NULL OR f.id IS NOT NULL)
GROUP BY c.id, c.company_name, c.subscription_tier, c.compliance_requirements
ORDER BY affected_emails + affected_files DESC;
EOF

kubectl exec -n phishnet statefulset/postgres -- psql -U phishnet_user -d phishnet -f /tmp/customer-impact.sql > /tmp/customer-impact-assessment.txt
```

### 3. Regulatory Compliance Assessment
```bash
# Identify data subject to specific regulations
cat << 'EOF' > /tmp/compliance-assessment.sql
-- GDPR assessment (EU customers)
SELECT 
  'GDPR' as regulation,
  COUNT(*) as affected_records,
  COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) as affected_customers
FROM emails e
JOIN customers c ON e.customer_id = c.id
WHERE c.region = 'EU' 
  AND e.last_accessed >= NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours';

-- HIPAA assessment (healthcare customers)
SELECT 
  'HIPAA' as regulation,
  COUNT(*) as affected_records,
  COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) as affected_customers
FROM emails e
JOIN customers c ON e.customer_id = c.id
WHERE c.industry = 'healthcare' 
  AND e.last_accessed >= NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours';

-- SOX assessment (financial customers)
SELECT 
  'SOX' as regulation,
  COUNT(*) as affected_records,
  COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) as affected_customers
FROM emails e
JOIN customers c ON e.customer_id = c.id
WHERE c.industry = 'financial' 
  AND e.last_accessed >= NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours';
EOF

kubectl exec -n phishnet statefulset/postgres -- psql -U phishnet_user -d phishnet -f /tmp/compliance-assessment.sql > /tmp/compliance-impact.txt
```

## Containment and Eradication (1-2 hours)

### 1. Complete Data Access Lockdown
```bash
# Implement emergency access controls
cat << EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: emergency-data-lockdown
  namespace: phishnet
spec:

      app: phishnet-api
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  ingress:
  - from:
    - namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          name: monitoring
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          app: emergency-access-only
  # Block all other ingress
EOF

# Rotate all API keys and secrets
kubectl create secret generic phishnet-api-secrets-new \
  --from-literal=api-key="$(openssl rand -hex 32)" \
  --from-literal=jwt-secret="$(openssl rand -hex 64)" \
  --from-literal=encryption-key="$(openssl rand -hex 32)" \
  -n phishnet

# Update deployment to use new secrets
kubectl patch deployment phishnet-api -n phishnet -p '
{
  "spec": {
    "template": {
      "spec": {
        "containers": [
          {
            "name": "api",
            "env": [
              {
                "name": "API_SECRET",
                "valueFrom": {
                  "secretKeyRef": {
                    "name": "phishnet-api-secrets-new",
                    "key": "api-key"
                  }
                }
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}'
```

### 2. Database Security Hardening
```bash
# Change database passwords
NEW_DB_PASSWORD=$(openssl rand -base64 32)
kubectl exec -n phishnet statefulset/postgres -- psql -U postgres -c "ALTER USER phishnet_user PASSWORD '$NEW_DB_PASSWORD';"

# Update database secret
kubectl patch secret phishnet-database-secrets -n phishnet -p '{"data":{"postgres-password":"'$(echo -n $NEW_DB_PASSWORD | base64)'"}}'

# Revoke unnecessary database privileges
kubectl exec -n phishnet statefulset/postgres -- psql -U postgres -d phishnet -c "
  REVOKE ALL ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public FROM phishnet_readonly;
  REVOKE ALL ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public FROM phishnet_readonly;
  REVOKE ALL ON ALL FUNCTIONS IN SCHEMA public FROM phishnet_readonly;
"

# Enable database audit logging
kubectl exec -n phishnet statefulset/postgres -- psql -U postgres -c "
  ALTER SYSTEM SET log_statement = 'all';
  ALTER SYSTEM SET log_connections = 'on';
  ALTER SYSTEM SET log_disconnections = 'on';
  SELECT pg_reload_conf();
"
```

### 3. Remove Compromised Access
```bash
# Invalidate all active user sessions
kubectl exec -n phishnet deployment/phishnet-api -- redis-cli -h redis FLUSHDB

# Force re-authentication for all users
kubectl exec -n phishnet statefulset/postgres -- psql -U phishnet_user -d phishnet -c "
  UPDATE users SET 
    session_token = NULL,
    last_logout = NOW(),
    force_password_reset = TRUE
  WHERE last_login >= NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours';
"

# Disable API access for suspicious applications
kubectl exec -n phishnet statefulset/postgres -- psql -U phishnet_user -d phishnet -c "
  UPDATE api_applications SET 
    status = 'suspended',
    suspended_at = NOW(),
    suspension_reason = 'Security incident investigation'
  WHERE last_used >= NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours';
"
```

### 4. Data Forensics and Recovery
```bash
# Create point-in-time recovery plan
RECOVERY_POINT=$(date -d '2 hours ago' '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')
echo "Recommended recovery point: $RECOVERY_POINT"

# Backup current state for forensics
kubectl exec -n phishnet statefulset/postgres -- pg_dump -U phishnet_user -d phishnet --format=custom > /tmp/incident-evidence-$INCIDENT_ID/database-current-state.dump

# Identify affected data for potential restoration
kubectl exec -n phishnet statefulset/postgres -- psql -U phishnet_user -d phishnet -c "
  CREATE TABLE incident_affected_data AS
  SELECT table_name, 'email' as data_type, id, last_accessed
  FROM emails
  WHERE last_accessed >= '$RECOVERY_POINT'
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 'file_analysis', 'file', id, created_at
  FROM file_analysis
  WHERE created_at >= '$RECOVERY_POINT';
"
```

## Recovery and Restoration (2-4 hours)

### 1. Validate System Integrity
```bash
# Run comprehensive security scan
kubectl create job security-post-incident-scan --image=security-scanner:latest -- /opt/scanner/comprehensive-scan.sh

# Wait for scan completion
kubectl wait --for=condition=complete job/security-post-incident-scan --timeout=1800s

# Review scan results
kubectl logs job/security-post-incident-scan > /tmp/incident-evidence-$INCIDENT_ID/post-incident-security-scan.log
```

### 2. Implement Enhanced Monitoring
```bash
# Deploy enhanced data access monitoring
cat << EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: enhanced-audit-config
  namespace: phishnet
data:
  audit-rules.yaml: |
    rules:

        alert_threshold: 10
EOF

# Deploy real-time data access monitor
kubectl apply -f k8s/monitoring/data-access-monitor.yaml
```

### 3. Gradual Service Restoration
```bash
# Re-enable API with enhanced security
kubectl patch configmap phishnet-api-config -n phishnet -p '{"data":{
  "DISABLE_SENSITIVE_ENDPOINTS":"false",
  "ENHANCED_AUDIT_LOGGING":"true",
  "RATE_LIMITING_STRICT":"true",
  "REQUIRE_2FA_FOR_SENSITIVE":"true"
}}'

# Restart API with new configuration
kubectl rollout restart deployment/phishnet-api -n phishnet

# Test API functionality with security monitoring
kubectl exec -n phishnet deployment/phishnet-api -- curl -s http://localhost:8000/health

# Gradually restore worker services
kubectl scale deployment phishnet-worker-email --replicas=1 -n phishnet
sleep 300

# Monitor for 5 minutes before scaling further
kubectl logs -n phishnet deployment/phishnet-worker-email --since=5m | grep -i error

# If no issues, scale to normal capacity
kubectl scale deployment phishnet-worker-email --replicas=2 -n phishnet
kubectl scale deployment phishnet-worker-analysis --replicas=2 -n phishnet
